# Enterprise Lithuania 

This repository is an asset generated by the Horizon 2020-funded Open Government Intelligence project. In particular, the tool presented in this reporsitory has been built to support the project pilot Enterprise Lithuania.

The tool is implemented using the well-established dynamic web technology ReactJS (https://reactjs.org/) 

A running instance of the tool can be found here: http://vmogi03.deri.ie:8081/

## Data

The visualizations available in this project consume data using CubiQL API (https://github.com/Swirrl/cubiql), another asset of this project.
Several datasets of interest for the pilot were converted into Linked Statistical Data using table2QB (https://github.com/Swirrl/table2qb).
Resulting RDF data can be found here: https://zenodo.org/record/2551455#.XFMIHFz7TmE

During the development of this project an NPM library was created, providing easy interface for the most common queries for multidimensional Linked Data Cubes, and making developers' tasks easier. This library supports javascript Promises and can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/cubiql-connector

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
